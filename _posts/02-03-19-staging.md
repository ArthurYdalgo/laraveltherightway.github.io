## Staging Environment {#staging-environment}

Staging servers is a type of server that is used to test a software, website or service in a production-similar environment before being set live. It is the role of a staging environment or staging site, to serve as a temporary hosting and testing server for any new software or feature.

- It is **RECOMMENDED** to use [**Continous Integration**](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration){:target="_blank"} to automatically run your Tests and keep a record of the results. For example [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/){:target="_blank"} or [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/){:target="_blank"}
