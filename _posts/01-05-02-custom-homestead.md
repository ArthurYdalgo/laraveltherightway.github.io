## Build your own Homestead {#custom_homestead_title}

When you use Homestead, there are pre-defined softwares already installed. If you want to customize the installed softwares, you will need to have an access to the scripts that is used to build Homestead itself. This project is called ["Settler"][settler-url]. You can check the source codes of that project to have a better understanding on how the Homestead was built, and probably add your own scripts as well.
