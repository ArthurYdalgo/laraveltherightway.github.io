## How to read this guide {#how-to-read-this-guide}

This guide is divided into several sections such as each one tries to group related conventions. For example, all database-related convention is grouped in the same section. Each of the convention have the following keywords, which indicates how important it is to comply with such convention:

* **MUST**   This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the
   definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
* **MUST NOT**   This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the
   definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.
* **SHOULD**   This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there
   may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a
   particular item, but the full implications must be understood and
   carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
* **SHOULD NOT**   This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that
   there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the
   particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full
   implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed
   before implementing any behavior described with this label.
* **MAY**   This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is
   truly optional.

the above specifications is derived from [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)
