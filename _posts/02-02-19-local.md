## Local Environment {#local-environment}

There are multiple ways to run Laravel in local environment as outlined below:

* [**Homestead**](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/homestead){:target="_blank"} - requires VirtualBox, Vagrant
* [**Valet**](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/valet){:target="_blank"} - only runs in MacOS
* [**Laradock**](https://laradock.io/){:target="_blank"}  - requires Docker Engine

You are free to choose which local environment that works for you and your team as long as the following conditions are met:

- Your local environment **MUST** be able to duplicate the production server or close to its specifications such as PHP version, extensions installed and MySQL version

- .env file **MUST NOT** be commited into repository

- You **SHOULD NOT** be connecting to your any production server when you are debugging locally, to prevent accidental corruption of data, unintended API call or similar incident.

- You **SHOULD NOT** be using personally identiable information (PII) of your  end-users  data or any data that could potentially identify a specific individual such as first/last name, address, medical condition so on and so forth, unless you are explicitly authorized by your company or client to do so.

- You  **MUST** update the readme.md file for any special instruction on how to run the app in local environment, so that other developers who will setup the app in their local machine can follow them properly.

- While it is possible to WAMP or XAMP for Laravel, this is un-common practice
so you  **SHOULD** try to familiarize yourself on how server components works and be comfortable in dealing with them.
