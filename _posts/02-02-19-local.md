## Local Environment {#local-environment}

There are multiple ways to run Laravel in local environment as outlined below:


* [**Homestead**](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/homestead){:target="_blank"} - requires VirtualBox, Vagrant
* [**Valet**](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/valet){:target="_blank"} - only runs in MacOS
* [**Laradock**](https://laradock.io/){:target="_blank"}  - requires Docker Engine

You are free to choose which local environment that works for you and your team as long as the following conditions are met:

- Your local environment **MUST** be able to duplicate or close to its specifications such as PHP version, extensions installed and MySQL version

- You **SHOULD NOT** be using personally identiable information (PII) of your  End-Users or any data that could potentially identify a specific individual such as first/last name, address, medical condition so on and so forth, unless you are explicitly authorized by your company or client to do so.
